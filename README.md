# Pig-game
Built a simple fun 2-player pig game using HTML, CSS and JS.

This game runs by rolling a dice. You keep rolling a dice and add on your current score. But you get a 1, your current score resets to 0. 
That's why it's crutial to hold your points and add it to your main score board. Have fun playing it!
